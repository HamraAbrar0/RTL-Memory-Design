# RTL-Memory-Design
It contains a SystemVerilog implementation of a memory module using interfaces and tasks for read/write operations. The design includes modports for memory controller and testbench communication, along with a Makefile for simulation and testing. The project demonstrates RTL design principles and verification techniques for memory systems.


# Memory Interface Design

This project implements a memory module in SystemVerilog using interfaces and tasks for read/write operations. It includes modports for memory controller and testbench communication, along with a Makefile for simulation and testing.

## Features
- SystemVerilog interfaces with modports for memory controller and testbench.
- Read/Write tasks for memory operations.
- Makefile for easy simulation and testing.

## Repository Structure
- `interface.sv`: SystemVerilog interface with modports.
- `mem.sv`: Memory module implementation.
- `mem_test.sv`: Testbench for memory module.
- `top.sv`:   Testbench for top module.
- `Makefile`: Automation for simulation and testing.
