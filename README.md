# RTL-Memory-Design
It contains a SystemVerilog implementation of a memory module using interfaces and tasks for read/write operations. The design includes modports for memory controller and testbench communication, along with a Makefile for simulation and testing. The project demonstrates RTL design principles and verification techniques for memory systems.
